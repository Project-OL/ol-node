#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Assert that the object storage a host is configured for matches what this
# environment is supposed to use, and print the resolved config into the deploy log.
#
# Piped over ssh/SSM the same way ec2-unpack-ol-node.sh is:
#   sudo APP_DIR=... EXPECT_STORAGE=r2 bash -s < .github/deploy/verify-storage-target.sh
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# Which object store the app talks to is decided at runtime by $APP_DIR/.env, never
# by the code:
#
#   S3_ENDPOINT_URL unset -> AWS S3        (prodv2, staging)
#   S3_ENDPOINT_URL set   -> Cloudflare R2 (GCP production)
#
# That separation is what makes it safe to run one codebase on every branch. The
# failure it cannot prevent on its own is a *host* whose .env does not match its
# environment: a GCP box missing S3_ENDPOINT_URL boots happily and writes user
# uploads into the AWS bucket, and nothing surfaces the mistake until objects are
# missing. This turns that silent mismatch into a failed deploy, before the new
# build is unpacked or pm2 is restarted.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = matches expectation, 1 = mismatch or unreadable env.
